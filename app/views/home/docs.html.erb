      <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

      <p>
        UndercoverCI is a robot who protects your Ruby codebase from untested code changes. It works with every Ruby project that can report test coverage with SimpleCov. Chances are, you're already doing that while running tests on a CI server.
      </p>

      <figure class="text-center my-4">
        <%= image_tag("passed-check.png", class: "border figure-img img-fluid docs-image-sm") %>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A passed coverage check.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The GitHub App reacts to commit and pull request events by queueing a new <code>coverage</code> check. Once your tests finish and upload the coverage report file, UndercoverCI parses the commit diff and correlates the structure of your changes (classes, modules, methods and blocks) against the uploaded test coverage report. The result is a passed or failed commit check reported to GitHub.
      </p>

      <h5>Passed</h5>
      <p>
        When the diff lines have full test coverage, you'll see a passed check with an additional breakdown of all changed code locations. Use it to find additional test coverage improvement opportunities in the surrounding lines and methods - reviewing your pull request is a good time to do that.
      </p>

      <h5>Failed</h5>
      <p>
        When untested lines or branches are found, a failed check will highlight them and ask you to add tests. Once tests are added, the comments will go away and the check status will turn to passed ✅.
      </p>

      <figure class="text-center my-4">
        <%= image_tag("location-breakdown.png", class: "border docs-image") %>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Every check from UndercoverCI, no matter whether passed or failed, includes some general stats: a list of changed methods, classes and blocks, their filenames, line coverage and branch coverage values.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <hr/>
      <h2 id="getting-started" class="mt-5">Getting started</h2>

      Follow these 3 steps to get started with UndercoverCI and receive automated test coverage comments.

      <h4 id="installation" class="mt-5 mb-2">1. Install the app on your GitHub account</h4>
      <p>
        Sign up from the home page or just follow <%= link_to("the GitHub sign up link", "/auth/github?r=sign_up", method: :post) %> to sign up. You'll be prompted to install the app on your GitHub account or organization and give permissions to selected repositories.
      </p>

      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        UndercoverCI is a subscription-based GitHub integration, although you can use it free of charge for public repositories, individual GitHub accounts and educational purposes.<br/><br/> For organizations, see the <%= link_to "pricing page", pricing_page_path, class: "alert-link" %> for more information as well as self-hosted options that will remain free forever.
      </div>

      <p>
        Once installed, UndercoverCI will send checks for every commit and pull request. There is just one final step to receive meaningful coverage results in them.
      </p>

      <h4 id="reporting" class="mt-5 mb-2">2. Report test coverage data to UndercoverCI</h4>

      <p>
        UndercoverCI analyses each commit against a matching test coverage file. Make sure your Ruby project reports test coverage and uploads the report file to UndercoverCI by following the instructions below:
      </p>

      <p>If your CI system isn't listed below, take a look at the general <a href="#undercover-uploader">uploader documentation</a> for more details.</p>

      <%= render partial: "partials/coverage_upload_instruction" %>

      <h4 id="verifying-setup" class="mt-5 mb-2">3. Verify your setup</h4>

      <p>
        You have installed the UndercoverCI GitHub app and configured your CI to publish test coverage reports for analysis. In order to verify that your setup is working, create a branch and push a small code change to your repository – adding a dummy method should suffice to trigger a sample coverage warning:
      </p>

      <figure class="text-center my-4">
        <%= image_tag("annotation.png", class: "border docs-image") %>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A GitHub code annotation triggered by untested diff lines.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        If you made it here, it means your code review setup with UndercoverCI is ready!
      </p>

      <h4 id="branch-cov" class="mt-5 mb-2">Branch coverage</h4>

      <p>UndercoverCI and <code>undercover</code> CLI (starting with version <code>>= 0.4.0</code>) both accept coverage reports with branch coverage data.</p> The <a href="#reporting">configuration example</a> already shows how to enable branch coverage in SimpleCov, which is all you need to receive more fine-grained coverage checks.

      <p>If you decide to enable branch coverage reporting, every changed line of code with at least one uncovered branch will be flagged and result in a GitHub annotation for the entire method. This is a more rigorous approach compared to just validating line-by-line test coverage.</p>

      <h4 id="undercover-cli" class="mt-5 mb-2">Shorten the feedback loop with the local CLI</h4>

      <p>
        UndercoverCI coverage comments are generated by the undercover ruby gem that you can use locally too. While GitHub Check comments provide coding standards and consistency, you can shorten your feedback loop and check for missing coverage with every local commit thanks to the <code>undercover</code> CLI command.

        You can install it from RubyGems with:
        <pre><code>
          gem install undercover
        </code></pre>
        Then, check for missing coverage inside uncommited changes by running specs and invoking <code>undercover</code>. Use the <code>--compare</code> flag to compare against a specific commit or branch, which is similar to what UndercoverCI performs when analysing your pushed pull requests:
        <pre><code>
          undercover --compare base-branch
          undercover --compare HEAD~1
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Visit the <a href="https://github.com/grodowski/undercover">undercover</a> GitHub page to see more examples including integrations with Overcommit and Pronto hooks.
      </p>

      <h4 id="coding-agents" class="mt-5 mb-2">Set up your coding agent</h4>

      <p>
        If you're using AI coding agents like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code or similar tools, you can guide them to write better tests with direct feedback from Undercover.
        The following system prompt example has been tested with Claude Code and helped it iterate towards correct coverage for the changes it made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note the following elements of the prompt:
        <ul>
        <li>emphasize the importance of testing every code change</li>
        <li>document the local tooling well: how to run tests, lint and coverage</li>
        <li>document any other preferences about the desired output style to save more time</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Example <code>AGENTS.md</code> configuration:
        <pre><code>
    ## Dev guidelines

    - All changes you make should be tested
    - Prefer updating existing tests (if they exist) over adding new test files
    - Always run tests and rubocop before completing your task
    - Do not add redundant comments
    - Do not say "You're absolutely right!"

    ## Bash commands

    bundle exec rake # run rspec tests and rubocop
    bundle exec rspec # run specs
    bundle exec rubocop # run rubocop lint
    bundle exec rubocop -A # correct correctable rubocop violations

    ## Test coverage

    bundle exec undercover # inspect coverage of local changes
    bundle exec undercover --compare master # inspect coverage w.r.t. master (for pull requests)
    bundle exec undercover --compare HEAD~1 # inspect coverage w.r.t. previous commit
        </code></pre>
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <h2 id="configuration" class="mt-5">Configuration</h2>
      <h4 id="undercover-uploader" class="mt-5 mb-2">UndercoverCI uploader</h4>

      <p>
        The uploader script runs in your CI build environment and uploads coverage reports to UndercoverCI. This way the coverage files are processed against a git diff and generate a commit check. A sample call for the <code>grodowski/undercover</code> repository built on CircleCI could look like this:

        <pre><code>
          ruby -e "$(curl -s https://undercover-ci.com/uploader.rb)" -- \
                    --repo grodowski/undercover \
                    --commit $CIRCLE_SHA1 \
                    --simplecov coverage/coverage.json
        </code></pre>

        The <code>uploader.rb</code> script is securely downloaded and evaluated with the required command-line options:
      </p>
      <p>
        <h6 class="mb-2 mt-3"><code>--repo</code></h6>
        The <code>$org/$repo</code> formatted name matching exactly how your repository appears on GitHub.

        <h6 class="mb-2 mt-3"><code>--commit</code></h6>
        Current build commit SHA to identify on GitHub. This value will be provided by the CI build environment, e.g.
        <code>$CIRCLE_SHA1</code> for CircleCI, <code>${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}</code> for
        GitHub Actions or <code>$TRAVIS_COMMIT</code> for TravisCI.</li> Consult your CI service documentation to get the
        right head SHA value for your build environment.

        <h6 class="mb-2 mt-3"><code>--cancel</code></h6>
        Cancel coverage check represented by the given <code>--commit</code>. The check will be passing and marked as completed + skipped on your GitHub commit or pull request.

        <h6 class="mb-2 mt-3"><code>--simplecov</code></h6>
        A relative path to the SimpleCov JSON coverage report, defaults to <code>coverage/coverage.json</code>.

        <h6 class="mb-2 mt-3"><code>--lcov</code> (legacy)</h6>
        A relative path to the LCOV coverage report. Still supported for backward compatibility, but SimpleCov JSON format is recommended.
      </p>

      <h4 id="parallel-tests" class="mt-5 mb-2">Parallel tests</h4>
      <p>
        If your CI build runs tests in parallel, there's an extra merge step to be performed before uploading coverage results, because the uploader script only accepts a single file at the time of writing this document. While partial coverage results might be supported in a future release, this Ruby snippet should get you started with merging multiple coverage reports:

        <pre><code>
          #!/usr/bin/env ruby
          # frozen_string_literal: true

          require 'simplecov'
          require 'undercover/simplecov_formatter'

          puts('Merging coverage results from parallel CircleCI tests containers into a single JSON report...')

          SimpleCov.collate(Dir['/home/circleci/rspec/*.resultset.json']) do
            enable_coverage(:branch)
          end

          report_path = ARGV[0] || 'coverage/coverage.json'
          SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::Undercover

          merged_result = SimpleCov.result
          merged_result.format!

          if File.size(report_path).zero?
            puts('Written report has 0 bytes')
            exit 1
          end
          puts("Done! Coverage saved to #{report_path}")
        </code></pre>
      </p>

      <h6>Parallel tests in <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#parallel-testing" target="_blank">Rails and Minitest</a></h6>
      <p>
        Try the snippet below to configure SimpleCov with <code>parallelize</code> in Rails and produce a single coverage output
        file that will be suitable for UndercoverCI.
        You can find more context in this <a href="https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov/issues/718#issuecomment-538201587" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a>.
        <pre><code>
          # test_helper.rb
          # ...
          parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)

          parallelize_setup do |worker|
            SimpleCov.command_name "#{SimpleCov.command_name}-#{worker}"
          end

          parallelize_teardown do |worker|
            SimpleCov.result
          end
          # ...
        </code></pre>
      </p>

      <h4 id="nocov-syntax" class="mt-5 mb-2">Ignoring/skipping coverage with code comments</h4>
      <p>
        Pull requests in projects with low or nonexistent test coverage are likely to generate large numbers of check warnings. While the default workflow would be to address them before the PR approval, your strategy might be different.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to acknowledge an untested change and remove the UndercoverCI warning with the intention to improve later (or never), you can wrap the code block with the <code>:nocov:</code> syntax, e.g.

        <pre><code>
          # :nocov:
          def skip_this_method
            never_reached
          end
          # :nocov:
        </code></pre>

        Read more about the <code>:nocov:</code> syntax in <a href="https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov#ignoringskipping-code" target="_blank">SimpleCov's readme</a>.
      </p>

      <h4 id="undercover-configuration-file" class="mt-5 mb-2">Configuration File</h4>
      <p>
        You can configure undercover options for your repository by placing a <code>.undercover</code> file in your repository root. This file uses the same format as the <a href="https://github.com/grodowski/undercover#configuration-file" target="_blank">undercover gem's configuration file</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example <code>.undercover</code> configuration:
        <pre><code>
          --exclude-files "vendor/*,db/*,bin/*,spec/*"
          --include-files "*.rb,*.rake"
        </code></pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        UndercoverCI will automatically detect and apply these settings when analyzing your coverage reports. Commonly used options include <code>--exclude-files</code> and <code>--include-files</code> for controlling which files are analyzed. Note that options meant for local undercover usage (like coverage file paths and git settings) will be overridden by UndercoverCI's own configuration. For a complete list of available options, see the <a href="https://github.com/grodowski/undercover#configuration-file" target="_blank">undercover gem documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <h4 id="branch-filtering" class="mt-5 mb-2">Branch filtering</h4>
      <p>
        UndercoverCI allows you to configure which branches should trigger coverage checks using regular expressions. This is useful for excluding certain branches like main, release branches, or including only branches with specific naming patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        To configure branch filtering, go to your Settings page and expand the configuration section for any repository. Enter a regular expression in the "Branch Filter" field that matches the branches you want to include for coverage checks.
      </p>

      <h6 class="mb-2 mt-3">Examples</h6>
      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="table table-sm">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Description</th>
              <th>Regular Expression</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Include only branches with "with-coverage-check" tag</td>
              <td><code>.*with-coverage-check.*</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Exclude main branch</td>
              <td><code>^(?!main$).*</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Exclude main and any branches starting with "release-"</td>
              <td><code>^(?!main$|release-).*</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Include only feature branches (starting with "feature/")</td>
              <td><code>^feature/.*</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Include development branches but exclude main, master, and release branches</td>
              <td><code>^(?!main$|master$|release-).*</code></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        Leave the field blank to run coverage checks on all branches. If you enter an invalid regular expression, UndercoverCI will default to checking all branches.
      </p>

      <h4 id="ignoring-test-coverage-checks" class="mt-5 mb-2">Skip coverage entirely</h4>

      <p>
        UndercoverCI checks can be skipped entirely if an analysis is redundant for any user-defined reason (e.g. commit is unrelated or tests haven't ran).
        Use the <code>--cancel</code> uploader option within your CI workflow to achieve this (<a href="#undercover-uploader">uploader docs</a>).
      </p>

      <h4 id="api" class="mt-5 mb-2">API V1</h4>

      <p>
        To access Undercover HTTP API, configure your per-user auth token using the API section of the Settings page.
      </p>

      <h5>GET /v1/checks/:commit_sha</h5>
      <p>
        Returns the coverage check information for the given commit SHA.

        Example:
